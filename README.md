# Final Project Dandelion

Final project created for the course GCT559 COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN at Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST). 

The result is a swaying dandelion which the user can interact with by blowing in their microphone. 

Created using Processing with Java. To run the app you will need to download Processing and open the folder in the program. Thereafter you can run 'final_project.pde'
